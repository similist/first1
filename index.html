<h2>FOOD의 중요성</h2>
<p>Food makes up an important part of my life. I not only really like eating but going out hanging, out with friends, enjoying culture, for me tends to revolve around
  <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/food?s=t"target="blank" title="definition of food">food</a>.<img src="edward-guk-357344.jpg" width="100%">
</p> <p style="margin-top:45px;">I also like to look up recipies and make food myself. Having someone <strong>appreciate something you <u>made</u> for them</strong> brings me a lot of joy although cooking can be quite laborsome, if the person that is eatting the food truly enjoys the food, then I become happy too and the effort that went in to making the food is all worth it.</p>
