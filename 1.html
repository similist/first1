<p>A small number of food historians believe that the tradition may have begun in Russia, where small snacks of fish, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caviar">caviar</a> and meats were common after long travels. However, it may be that the custom originated in China, possibly coming through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe">Steppes</a>, into Russia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, France and other European countries.
The tradition may have reached Italy, Greece and the Balkan nations through Russia or Persia. Many national customs are related, including the Swedish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord">smörgåsbord</a>, Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakuski">zakuska</a>, Lebanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezze">mezze</a>, and Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezze">antipasto</a>. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman Period</a> the meal practice was to have two main courses which were supplemented before the meal with small amounts of fish, vegetables, cheeses, olives and even stuffed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_dormouse">dormice</a>. These would be served at the start of the meal known as either <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gustatio"><i>gustatio</i></a> or <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/promulsis"><i>promulsis</i></a>. - From wikipedia
